A Kalman filter is a recursive mathematical algorithm used for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system when you have noisy measurements or observations. It's particularly useful in situations where you need to predict the future state of a system based on past observations while taking into account the inherent uncertainty or noise in both the measurements and the dynamics of the system.
